# Hello Phoenix

An attempt to build an interactive and maintainable web application using the Phoenix Framework. 
I am also using this repository to experiment with elixir and its core concepts in web development.

Check https://github.com/apostergiou/phoelr for a more advanced project where I cover the following:

- Controllers and Views
- Ecto
- User authentication
- Generators
- Relationships
- Channels
- OTP
- Observer
- Umbrellas
- Tests

## Getting Started

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
